### ✅ **Task 8: Lambda, Map, Filter, and Reduce**

#### **Instructions:**

1. Create a lambda function to:

   * Add 10 to a number.
   * Multiply two numbers.
   * Return `True` if a number is even.

2. Use `map()` to:

   * Square all numbers in a list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. Use `filter()` to:

   * Get all numbers greater than 10 from: `[4, 15, 8, 22, 7, 3]`.

4. Use `reduce()` from the `functools` module to:

   * Calculate the product of all numbers in a list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

#### **Bonus:**

* Combine `map()` and `filter()` to:

  * Square only the even numbers from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

🧠 **Hint:**

```python
from functools import reduce
```
