### âœ… **Task 2: String Manipulation and Formatting**

#### **Instructions:**

Create a Python script that:

2. Converts the name to:

   * Uppercase
   * Lowercase
   * Title Case
3. Counts the number of characters (excluding spaces).
4. Reverses the full name.
5. Checks if the name contains the letter `'a'` or `'A'`.
6. Splits the name into first and last name using `.split()`.

  `"Hello, [FIRST_NAME]! Your name has [X] characters."`
