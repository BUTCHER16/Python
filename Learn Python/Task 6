### ✅ **Task 6: Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Tuples:**

   * Create a tuple with 5 different fruits.
   * Access the 2nd and 4th item using indexing.
   * Try modifying an element and observe the error (immutability).

2. **Sets:**

   * Create two sets:

     ```python
     set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
     set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7}
     ```
   * Perform and print:

     * Union
     * Intersection
     * Difference (`set1 - set2`)
   * Add a new item to `set1`.

3. **Dictionaries:**

   * Create a dictionary of 3 employees with their names as keys and salaries as values.
   * Add a new employee to the dictionary.
   * Update the salary of an employee.
   * Loop through the dictionary and print names and salaries.

#### **Bonus:**

* Use `get()` to safely access a key that might not exist.
* Check if a key exists before updating.
